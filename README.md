### Balance Changes:

#### Industry

Top 25 Industrial powers that are civilized will have a machine part factory, may change this later. Players with iron deposits should build steel factories if they don't want all their iron exported.

##### British Isles

Due to the fact that Brittania would be given 4 facorties for free (England, Westminister, Wales, and Scotland), Wales and Westminster will not receive one.

##### Germany

Due to how rare Germany seems to form in ToL the De Jure Germany will have 8 factories, so that the Germans will be even more powerful and give players a bit more incentive to try and form it. May cut in half if unbalanced, or allow Brit to have all 4.

Bavaria has a winery

##### Russia

Russia will not recieve one to slow down their industrialization, and to ensure the 2nd largest producer of steel doesn't hog ithe world supply.

##### Hanseatic

the Hanseatic state itself will not get a machine part factory but it's pupet Brandenburg will instead.

##### Other Nations

Due to the canonical lack of industrialization in the nations of Provence, Freiland, Denmark-Norway, Lithuiania, Sweden, Toledo. They will have to reply on sphereing and trade to get machine parts.

##### Italy

Venice has a Glass factory and added factory workers.
